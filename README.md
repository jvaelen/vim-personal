# About

This repository contains my personal .vim folder (as a way to synchronize plug-ins between machines or to share with other people).
NOTE: not all plugins are proper submodules and can thus be synchronized. E.g. YouCompleteMe, because it requires a proper installation.

# Installation

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/jvaelen/vim-personal.git .vim
    cd .vim
    git submodule update --init
